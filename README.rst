**IMPORTANT:** Model Mommy is no longer maintained and was replaced by `Model Bakery <https://pypi.org/project/model-bakery/>`_. Please, consider `migrating your project <https://model-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating_from_mommy.html>`_ to use the new lib.

Model Mommy's creator and the maintainers decided to rename the project to not reinforce gender stereotypes for women in technology. You can read more about this subject `here <https://www.witi.com/articles/1017/How-Gender-Stereotypes-are-Still-Affecting-Women-in-Tech/>`_.
